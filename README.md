If you are interested only in running the application and not running the code in find_mood folder, 
then requirements.txt should be enough to fulfil the requriements to create the development environment,
else use extensive_requirements.txt

##
Upon cloning this repo and creating a development environment, please run python app.py while checking into the folder

This will spin up the development server and you shall be prompted to a link of the form http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which you can paste in your browser and interact with this application
